## Notice:

Aside from meta fields, this schema is NOT reliable or under our control!
All other fields and data are pulled directly from the Inspec output JSON.
Therefore, though we've made our best effort to be comprehensive in this document,
any changes or not-well-documented output outside of the meta field are not under our control.


## Other notes:
 *  The provided values are simply examples, EXCEPT in the case of the meta "subtype" field, which is always the same for each event type
    (IE a control meta.subtype will ALWAYS be "control")
 *  , EXCEPT in cases where the value is presented as "Alpha | Beta | Delta",
    in which case the actual value can be any one of the listed values.
